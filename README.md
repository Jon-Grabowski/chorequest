Welcome to ChoreQuest!

ChoreQuest is a choose your own adventure game where your mission is to complete your chores so you can relax on your day off, however, there are many twists, turns, and monsters that are trying to derail you from completing your errands.

Opening the Game: To open ChoreQuest you will have to install the dependencies needed for playing the game (Terminal Command: npm install). You will then need to run your React server (Terminal Command: npm start). We also have a json server that you will need to run on port 3001 (Terminal Command: json-server --watch db.json --port 3001). Make sure you're running the json server on port 3001, or you won't get to experience all of our fun ChoreMonsters!

Playing the Game: We open our game on the Home page, with links in the Nav Bar that will direct you to our Add New Monster page, and our Monster List Page. On our Monster List page, you get to explore some of the Monsters that you may encounter on your quest. On our Add New Monster Page, you can create a monster of your own that you may come up against in the game! To start the game, navigate to the Home page and press the "Begin Adventure" button.

Enjoy and thank you for playing ChoreQuest! Good Luck!
